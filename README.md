# NYC Open Data Analytics Project

This project explores open datasets from the City of New York (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) to uncover meaningful insights about city operations, public services, and resident experiences.  
Using Python-based analytics tools, the project aims to help various stakeholders—such as local policymakers, community leaders, and businesses—better understand trends, challenges, and opportunities across NYC’s neighborhoods and agencies.

The workflow includes collecting data from NYC Open Data, performing data cleaning, conducting exploratory and statistical analysis, and summarizing findings in a clear, actionable report.
